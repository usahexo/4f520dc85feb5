Some of the most important include crafting thoughtful and well-targeted messages, personalizing content to appeal to individual customers, and using AI to automate email campaigns and target leads.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting thoughtful and well-targeted messages, it’s important to remember that not all customers are the same. You need to take into account their interests, needs, and past behavior in order to create messages that will resonate with them. Personalizing content is also key – when customers feel like you’re speaking directly to them, they’re more likely to respond positively.\n\nUsing AI to automate email campaigns and target leads is another great way to make the most of AI-powered email marketing.
